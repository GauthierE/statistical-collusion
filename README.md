# statistical-collusion

This repository contains the code for reproducing the experiments and figures presented in the paper [Statistical Collusion by Collectives on Learning Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04879).

## Organization

The repository is organized into four main folders:

```
├── notebooks/
│   ├── dataset/
│   │   └── create_synthetic_dataset.ipynb     # generates the dataset
│   ├── run/
│   │   ├── signal-planting.ipynb              # signal planting using the feature-label strategy
│   │   ├── signal-planting-fo.ipynb           # signal planting using the feature-only strategy
│   │   ├── signal-planting-N.ipynb            # signal planting for y^* = Poor across different N values
│   │   └── signal-unplanting.ipynb            # signal unplanting for y^* = Excellent
│   └── plot/                                  # generates plots based on runs
├── output/                                    # contains outputs generated by the code
├── plots/                                     # stores the final plots
├── src/
│   └── utils.py                               # main code used across all notebooks
```

## Description of Experiments

This repository considers four **key scenarios** from the paper:

- Signal planting with feature-label strategy
- Signal planting with feature-only strategy
- Signal planting for y* = *Poor* across different values of N
- Signal unplanting for y* = *Excellent*

## Instructions

1. Create the Dataset:
- Run the notebook `notebooks/dataset/create_synthetic_dataset.ipynb` to generate the dataset.
- This will create a `data/` folder at the root level containing the dataset.

> [!NOTE]
>  The dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints. Running the dataset generation notebook will create the necessary data locally.

2. Run the Experiments:
- Navigate to `notebooks/run/` and execute any of the following notebooks based on the scenario you wish to reproduce:
  - `notebooks/run/signal-planting.ipynb`
  - `notebooks/run/signal-planting-fo.ipynb`
  - `notebooks/run/signal-planting-N.ipynb`
  - `notebooks/run/signal-unplanting.ipynb`
- The outputs from the experiments will be stored in the `output/` folder.

3. Plot the Figures:
- Execute the notebook in `notebooks/plot/` to generate the figures.
- The resulting figures will be saved in the `plots/` folder.
